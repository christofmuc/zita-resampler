# First version of conanfile
# Only Windows uses this.
# 
# Build zita-resampler on Windows only after running conan install:
#
# mkdir builds
# cd builds
# conan install ..
#
# we use the CMake multi generator and the find_package_multi for Visual Studio
#
# This creates a Findpthreads4w.cmake file in the binary directory
# Use it by specifying -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=builds when configuring the project
#
[requires]
# This dependency is required for Windows only. How to do this with Conan?
pthreads4w/3.0.0

[generators]
# For Windows, we will use cmake-multi, because you have debug and release in one cmake file
cmake_multi
cmake_paths
cmake_find_package_multi
# On Linux, we'd like to use simple cmake
# cmake
